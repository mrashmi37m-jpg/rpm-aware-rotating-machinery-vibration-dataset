This repository contains experimental vibration data collected from rotating machinery operating under variable-speed conditions. The dataset supports fault diagnosis, severity estimation, and health index construction using RPM-aware vibration analytics.

## Fault Classes
- Healthy
- Misalignment
- Unbalance
- Bearing fault

## Data Format
- Time-domain vibration signals
- Associated RPM labels
- Feature-level representations (optional)

## Usage
The dataset can be used for research in predictive maintenance, fault diagnosis, and interpretable machine learning.

## Availability
The dataset is provided for academic research purposes only.
